# 🎉 KH Events - Local Event Discovery Platform

## 📝 Project Summary

KH Events is a **local event discovery platform** built to help users find activities, concerts, festivals, and other local events based on their **location and interests**. The platform allows users to browse event listings, book tickets, and receive event reminders.

It is designed with three key components:
- **Frontend**: For end-users and event organizers to explore, manage, and book events.
- **Backend (Admin Panel)**: For platform administrators to manage users, events, and platform settings.
- **API**: A central system supporting the frontend, admin panel, and mobile integration.

The goal is to provide a seamless experience for users, organizers, and admins — making it easier for people to find, participate in, and manage events with secure transactions and automated notifications.
